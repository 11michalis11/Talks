# Michalis Annual Review
- Very nice start to your talk Michalis.
- A “great thing” -> not necessarily.
- Not everyone would know what an arrival rate is.
- Your explanation of T could be a bit clearer: “It is how full the system needs to be for the Hospital to start keeping patients in their ambulances”.
- Who are the lambda ones in practice?
- I think your Markov chain diagram could have a line across it to show the $T$.
- At some point I think you should highlight that the queuing model is written in a completely generic way
- Your histograms should include a plot of the mean for the simulation (to show that they match)
- “A strategy that corresponds to one of each Markov chains” was a really nice way of putting it. You could possibly have that as a diagram.
- Your ambulance choice heatmap needed the probability (what you were plotting)) labelled.
- Your game should have the utilities rounded (for the purpose of the presentation),
- Your microphone acts weird, i think it’s very targeted so if/when you move your sound changes a lot.
- I think more details about the asymmetric replicator dynamics would have been helpful. Describing what you mean by a learning algorithm, versus a NE etc…
- Better introduction to PoA (possibly even with a discussion of the literature - Paul and my paper, also Komenda et al paper).
