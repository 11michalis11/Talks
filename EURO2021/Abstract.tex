    The main focus of this study is the construction of a 3-player game 
    theoretic model between two queueing systems and a service that distributes 
    individuals to them. 
    The resultant model will then be used to explore dynamics between all 
    players.

    The first aspect of this work is the development of a queueing system
    with two waiting spaces and two types of individuals. 
    Two modelling techniques were used, discrete event 
    simulation and Markov chains. 
    The state probabilities of the Markov chain system have been used to extract
    the performance measures of the queueing model (e.g. mean time in each 
    waiting room, mean number of individuals in each room, etc.).
    Given two such systems, the scenario explored is
    how to distribute individuals among the two in order to optimise certain
    performance measures. 
    A 3-player game theoretic model is proposed between the two
    queueing systems and the service that distributes individuals to them. 
    In particular this can be seen as a 2-player normal-form game where the 
    utilities are determined by a third player with its own strategies and 
    objectives. 
    A backwards induction technique is used to get the utilities of the 
    normal-form game between the two queueing systems.

    This particular system can be applied in a healthcare scenario where it 
    could capture the emergent behaviour between the Emergency Medical Service 
    (EMS) and the Emergency Department (ED). 
    The model will be used to form a 3-player game between the EDs of two 
    neighbouring hospitals and the EMS.
