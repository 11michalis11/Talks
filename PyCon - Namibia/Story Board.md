# Story Board

## 1. Title Page
- About me
- Cardiff University
- THIS Institute


## 2. Queues
- Different examples of queues
  - Maybe a post-office queue (cannot choose the wrong queue)
  - Supermarket queues (can choose the wrong queue)
  - Maths to analyse this
- Healthcare queues
  - Ambulances picture


## 3. Queue with 2 waiting rooms
- DES general diagram
  - Post office
  - Supermarket
- DES queueing diagram with 2 waiting rooms
  - Ambulance - ED

## 4. Simulating the queue (Jupyter notebook)
- Differences between M|M|1 and M|M|c queue (DES image, code, DES image, code)
  - M|M|1 - ciw library made by Dr. Geraint Palmer (talks in PyCon Namibia)
  - M|M|c - with ciw
  - Multiple runs
- Queue with 2 waiting zones 
  - DES image 
  - Inheriting code
  - Running code


## 5. Markov Chains (analytical formulation)
- We are able to get results faster
- M|M|1 queue
  - Markov Chain
  - Matrix
- M|M|c chain
  - Markov Chain
  - Matrix
- Two waiting rooms queue
  - Markov Chain
  - Matrix
- Jupyter notebook 
- 

## 6. Comparisons
- Markov VS Simulation


## 7. Game between two queues
- Distributor VS Queue VS Queue
- How to handle inefficiencies


## 8. Discussion
- Different type of inefficiencies
  - Supermarket (might want inefficiencies)
  - Hospital (very easy to arrive at inefficiencies)
