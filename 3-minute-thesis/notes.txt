Slide 0:
    - Michalis Panayides
    - Talk about the gaming that happens in the interface of ED - EMS

Slide 1:
    - Interaction between UK Event Medical Services and Emergency Department (Ambulance service - Hospital)
    - Two patient types: Ambulance, others
    (CLICK)
    - Within 4 hours to start recieving treatment
    - Proportion of patients within 4 hours decrease - caused by rising demand in ED

Slide 2:
    - An attempt ot fix by the ED staff: leave patients outside in ambulances
    - Timer does not start unless they enter the hospital,
        - Which is great: better to wait inside the ambulance with a paramedic
        - BUT ambulances remain BLOCKED and can't collect other patients
        - AND creates a mess outside the ED

Slide 3:
    - Model of the system
    - Other patients arrive directly
    - Ambulance Patients arrive at parking and then proceed
    (CLICK)
    - Include the blocking element in the model
    - Allow patients if DO NOT exceed threshold

Slide 4:
    - Hospital's chooices: Decide threshold level (when to reject patients)
    - Assume capacity of 6: 6 strategies
    (CLICK)
    - Assuming there are two hospitals that compete:
        - 36 possible utilities combined outcomes
        - Each utility: proportion of people that satisfy NHS target time
        - e.g. Describe cell (prop of ind within target)
    (CLICK)
    - Utilities depend on the ambulance's decision
    - Ambulance's decision (Infinite): Proportion to send to hospitals
    - where p1+p2 = 1    

Slide 5:
    - Total Capacity = 6, Threshold = 3, Ambulance Arrival Rate = 9 per hour
    - Distribution of patients between the two hospitals
