Slide 1:
    - Interaction between UK Event Medical Services and Emergency Department (Ambulance service - Hospital)
    - Patient flow from ambulance to treatment
    - Two patient types: Ambulance, others
    - Within 4 hours to start recieving treatment
    - Proportion of patients within 4 hours decrease - caused by rising demand in A&E departments

Slide 2:
    - An attempt ot fix by the ED staff: leave patients outside in ambulances
    - Timer does not start unless they enter the hospital,
    - Which is great: better to wait inside the ambulance with a paramedic
    - BUT creates a mess outside the ED
    - AND ambulances remain blocked and can't collect other patients

Slide 3:
    - Model of the system
    - Other patients arrive directly
    - Ambulance Patients arrive at parking and then proceed
    - Representative model: Blocked ambulances

Slide 4:
    - Game between two hospitals and an ambulance
    - Blocking times
